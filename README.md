# Data-Modelling-with-Postgres-

#### Overview
A startup Sparkify (imaginary music streaming company) have been collecting data about songs and users activity across their platform. The analytics team wants to analyze and understand what songs users are interested listening to. The data is spread across multiple json files, which makes it hard to query and do the analysis.

The goal of this project is to create a postgres data model and develop an ETL pipeline that transfers data from local json files to these tables in postgres database making it easier for the analytics team to analyze the data and understand the user behaviour. 


#### Datasets
Currently, data is collected for songs and user activities in two different directories (`song and log`),using json format.
